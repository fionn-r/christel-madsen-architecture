The triangular site between Sigurdsgade, Titangade and Vermundsgade in Copenhagen NV represents a special diversity in the city in terms of function, volumes and people. A place we wanted to gather in a diverse meeting between the walls that today acts as barriers, cutting off the different programs from each other.

We have worked with the meeting between the defined and the undefined programs and buildings. In the study of the human encounter in an intimate urban space, we have examined the wall as a shaping element.

The triangular site exudes a special atmosphere, which we wanted to preserve and strengthen with this project. By connecting and activating the area and its unrealized potentials, and creating coexistence between businesses, associations, and the city, we have given the place a voice in the city.

This project was made together with  Sheila Koyo MÃ¸ller and Sofie Hypholt during our 2nd semester of masters.
